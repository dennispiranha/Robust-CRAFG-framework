# Robust-CRAFG-framework (Robust Common-Root Aware Feature Generation)

This repository contains the official implementation of the research paper:
"Robust-CRAFG: A Common-Root-Aware Framework for Efficient Feature Generation on High-Dimensional and Imbalanced Data" (Author: Teerapat Chundetsumrit, 2025).

Overall of framework
The proposed framework enhances classification performance on both balanced and imbalanced datasets by combining feature generation, selection, and resampling strategies such as the Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
